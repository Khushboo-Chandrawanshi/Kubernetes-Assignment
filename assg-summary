ASSIGNMENT 4
There are a few reasons for using proxying for Services:

. There is a long history of DNS implementations not respecting record TTLs, and caching the results of name lookups after they should have expired.
. Some apps do DNS lookups only once and cache the results indefinitely.
. Even if apps and libraries did proper re-resolution, the low or zero TTLs on the DNS records could impose a high load on DNS that then becomes difficult to manage
